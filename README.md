# challenge-git
- In this Challenge I first created a Repo on GitHub. 
- I then cloned it and set my upstream to the url of the newly created repo. 
- Following that I created two branches (add-echo and add-reverse). 
- Finally I used git rebase to rebase the two branches to the main branch of my repo.
